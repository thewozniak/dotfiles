## dotfiles

These are my personal dofilest. If you'd like to learn more about it, check out [GitHub ‚ù§ ~/](http://dotfiles.github.io) page.

It helps me and speeds up system configurations, to my preferred settings. In addition to configuring macOS to the defaults I use, you can install the following development environment components and libraries:
+ <strong>Mac App Store command-line interface</strong>
+ <strong>Xcode command-line tools</strong>
+ <strong>Homebrew</strong>
+ <strong>OpenSSL</strong>
+ <strong>Wget</strong>
+ <strong>PHP (8.x)</strong>
+ <strong>Nginx (1.2x.x)</strong>
+ <strong>Composer</strong>
+ <strong>Node</strong>
- MongoDB PHP Driver
- OAuth consumer extension
- Redis PHP extension
- mailparse PHP extension
- msgpack PHP extension
- imagick (ImageMagick)
- pkg-config (helper tool)
+ Karabiner-elements
+ Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
+ NoSQLBooster for MongoDB
+ Realm Studio



During the installation process, you can install additional libraries available in the homebrew repository.
<br /><br />

## Install

Run this:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thewozniak/dotfiles/main/remote.sh)"
```

This will download and run the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your $HOME directory.

Don't worry! Once the process is complete, all files will be cleaned up.

After the installation is complete, <strong>PHP</strong> and <strong>Nginx</strong> are running because they were started during the installation process.

To display the status of running services, type: `dev status`.

If you nedd to stop dev-env, type as following: `dev stop`.
<br /><br />

## Usage
